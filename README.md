# Hello, I'm Leeya! :smile:

I'm a software engineer based in NYC, looking to leverage my background in communication and problem-solving, to excel at a great company!

My exceptional interpersonal communication skills allow me to work well in a collaborative environment and independently. Working for the City of New York helped me refine these and other skills such as open-mindedness, organization, and empathy.

I am passionate about continuing education and look forward to adding to my skill set with the goal of deepening my cloud computing skillsÂ by becoming a certified AWS Solutions Architect Associate by the end of 2024.

### What I'm doing

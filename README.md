# Hello, I'm Leeya! :smile:

I'm a software engineer based in NYC, who enjoys problem solving!

I have a deep appreciation for the structured approach because I believe a well-thought-out algorithm is better than writing a premature solution based on assumptions made at a glance.

I am passionate about continuing education and look forward to adding to my skill set with the goal of deepening my cloud computing skillsÂ by becoming a certified AWS Solutions Architect Associate by the end of 2024.

Let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leeya-d-a8542565/)!

## What I'm doing

:fox_face: I'm a Firefox Community Contributer!

## What I've done

### :sparkles: Twine Real-Time :sparkles:

I recently created [Twine](https://twine-realtime.github.io/), an open-source, scalable WebSocket service with connection state recovery. It's for developers looking to add real-time functionality to their existing applications!
